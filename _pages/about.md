As of 2024, I am a 4th year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering (mechanics and materials track) in [Nguyen Lab](https://nguyenlab.wse.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Before Hopkins, I got my MS from Washington State University, Pullman, and BS from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, all in Mechanical Engineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of solid mechanics, computational methods, and materials modeling. Currently, I am working on developing multiphysics framework, constitutive models, and numerical implementations for stimuli-responsive hydrogels for soft sensing and robotics applications as well as water harvesting. Because of the uncanny fundamental similarities between soft active materials and biological tissues, I am also interested in the biomechanics of tissues. Previously, I worked on the thermomechanical failure of 2.5D/3D microelectronics packaging and continuum dislocation plasticity modeling.

Besides engineering, I have always found anthropology, mythology, and sociology very fascinating. In leisure, I love watching standup comedies and sitcoms, listening to music, going on road trips, reading comics, and sometimes [writing blogs](/blog/).
