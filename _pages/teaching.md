I have been fortunate enough to be actively involved in educating next generation engineers as a teaching assistant and instructor during my graduate studies. Currently, my teaching interests are centered around **solid mechanics** and **computational methods**. Given that I hold the permission, if you would like to access to the course materials for any of the following classes, send me an email.
